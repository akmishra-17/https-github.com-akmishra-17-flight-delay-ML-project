✈️ Flight Delay Prediction using Machine Learning
A Multi-Model Framework for Predicting Commercial Flight Delays

This repository presents a complete end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline designed to analyse airline operational data and predict flight arrival delays.
The project combines supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and feature extraction techniques to build a high-performance prediction system.

🚀 Project Highlights

✔ Full data preprocessing and feature engineering
✔ PCA-based dimensionality reduction
✔ K-Means clustering for pattern discovery
✔ Multiple ML classification models
✔ Extensive evaluation using precision, recall, F1, accuracy & AUC
✔ Over 14 high-quality visualisations generated automatically

🛫 Dataset

The model uses a publicly available Airline On-Time Performance dataset (USA, 2023).
It contains real flight-level metrics including:
